### Description
This is a facility locator that I built when I was living in Hayward, CA. Students at California State University East bay were having trouble to find the buildings by their names, and at the time, the school had only a non-interactive map, which served as an extra motivation to build this app.
<br />

### How it works
Users will see categories of facilities in the main screen, such as dinning places, buildings, shuttle stops and parking lots. Then they will have a list of all the mapped buildings in each category. Once they choose the one they want, they'll be able to see the places's location on a map, alogside with some specific information, as a phone number, the type of parking, the buses and shuttles that stops by and etc.
<br />

### Technologies
This project was built in Java for a native Android experience, in early 2016.
<br />

### APK
The apk can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/thiagoloschi/CampusLocator/raw/master/CampusLocator.apk).
