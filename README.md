### Description
This is a facility locator, I built when I was living in Hayward, CA. Students at California State University were having trouble to find the buildings by their names, and the school, at the time, had only a non-interactive map, which served as the main motivation to build this app.
<br />

### How it works

### Technologies
This project was built in Java for a native Android experience, in 2015.
