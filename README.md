### Description
This is a facility locator, I built when I was living in Hayward, CA. Students at California State University were having trouble to find the buildings by their names, and the school, at the time, had only a non-interactive map, which served as the main motivation to build this app.
<br />

### How it works
The user will see categories of facilities in the main screen, such as dinning, sports, shuttle stops and so on, then they will have a list of all the mapped buildings in each category. Once they choose the one they want, they'll be able to see its location on a map, along some information about the place chosen.
<br />

### Technologies
This project was built in Java for a native Android experience, in 2015.
<br />

### APK
The apk can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/thiagoloschi/CampusLocator/raw/master/CampusLocator.apk).
